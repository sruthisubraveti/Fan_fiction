The Bulls Fiction Factory

![project logo bull (1)](https://github.com/sruthisubraveti/Fan_fiction/assets/172334062/eef8fa18-c674-4bb8-8e37-cc72c2438a6b)


The main purpose of this project is to develop a web platform for creating and sharing fan fiction works. Users can upload fan fiction tales about selected movies anonymously or under a specific account. The project uses MongoDB as the backend storage solution and integrates it with Flask, a Python web framework, to manage data and perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) activities. To improve the user experience, the application seeks to provide a dynamic and engaging user interface built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It also addresses the constraints of the present fan fiction platform by suggesting prospective enhancements like as cloud hosting, premium MongoDB plans, and new features like user accounts and review/comment functionality.
